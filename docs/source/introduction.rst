Introduction
============

Imagine a number of different devices that one would like to integrate into
EPICS. They use a common communication protocol or software library, but are
otherwise substantially different. A concrete example would be a number of PLCs
that have different roles and attached peripherals. The device variables exposed
by each device are different, and although the interface library or protocol
allows one to reach all variables, implementing separate EPICS support for each
device is tedious.

It is convenient to have generic EPICS device support implementing the common
protocol (or using the common library), then binding records to the variables
available on each device solely through EPICS database record definitions.

Consider a fictitious example::

  record(ai, "$(PREFIX):DEV1:Temperature") {
      field(DTYP, "myDevSup")
      field(INP, "@dev=1 type=float addr=0x5042")
  }

  record(longin, "$(PREFIX):DEV1:Status") {
      field(DTYP, "myDevSup")
      field(INP, "@dev=1 type=short addr=0x50a1")
  }

  record(ai, "$(PREFIX):DEV2:Temperature") {
      field(DTYP, "myDevSup")
      field(INP, "@dev=2 type=float addr=0xfb03")
  }

The ``myDevSup`` EPICS device support layer and the underlying driver need know
nothing about the device variables, they merely know how to parse the string
given in the records' INP/OUT links and shuffle the requested data to and from
the registers at the specified addresses. Depending on how communication to the
device is implemented, it is even possible that no connection to a device exists
until a record requesting it is initialized.

``autoparamDriver`` makes implementing such a generic driver easier by

* dynamic creation of handles for each device device variable that is requested
  by EPICS records during IOC initialization;
* providing facilities for forwarding hardware interrupts to ``I/O Intr`` records;
* being based on ``asynPortDriver`` with all the benefits this brings â€” most
  importantly, generic EPICS device support layer with a number of useful
  features;
* supplementing ``asynPortDriver`` with a more homogeneous C++ interface

  * by allowing registration of handler functions instead of requiring the
    driver to override read and write methods and dispatch "manually".
  * by providing a templated ``setParam()`` in lieu of separate
    ``setIntegerParam()``, ``setDoubleParam()`` etc.

Variables, records and reasons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is a device variable?
```````````````````````````

A **device variable** is a piece of data on a device. A *process variable* is a
piece of data accessible via Channel Access or PV Access protocol on an EPICS
network. The goal of a driver based on ``autoparamDriver`` is to map device
variables to EPICS records, which in turn make them available as process
variables on the network.

When mentioning a "variable", this documentation always refers to a *device
variable*, never a process variable.

How does a record refer to a device variable?
`````````````````````````````````````````````

As ``autoparamDriver`` is based on ``asyn``, it leverages its generic device
support and INST_IO link parsing. It relies on ``asyn``'s ``DrvUser`` interface
to obtain a so-called "reason string". A record thus looks like::

  record(ai, "$(PREFIX):DEV1:Temperature") {
      field(DTYP, "asynFloat64")
      field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT_NAME)) this is a reason string")
  }

Here, the macro ``$(PORT_NAME)`` refers to an instance of a driver derived from
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver`. When the record is initialized, the driver will
be given the entire reason string. It is split on the first space and the first
word (in the above example, "this") is called a **function** while the rest are
called **arguments**.

The combination of a function and its arguments is called a **device address**.
Any record referring to the same combination of function and arguments will have
the same address, and will thus bind to the same **device variable**. When
records are being initialized, the following happens:

* :cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` calls
  :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::parseDeviceAddress()`, which is implemented
  by the derived driver, to parse the reason string and return an
  :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceAddress`.
* :cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` checks whether any of the records that were
  already initialized refer to the same address, reusing the underlying
  variable's handle if possible.
* If not, :cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` calls
  :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::createDeviceVariable()` to instantiate a new
  :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable`.

Each device variable is backed by a **parameter**. This term refers to
asyn-managed cache of device variable properties (c.f.
:cpp:func:`asynPortDriver::createParam()`), such as general status, alarm
status, and (for scalars) value. While handlers (described below) are used to
update records on request from the EPICS database, parameters are used to update
records on request from the driver (e.g. in response to hardware interrupts).

How does the driver refer to a device variable?
```````````````````````````````````````````````

As the IOC is initialized, the driver will automatically identify the requested
variables and instantiate parameters as described above. Instances of
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable` serve as handles:

* when a record is processed, the driver is given a ``DeviceVariable``
  identifying which data the record is interested in;
* when the driver wants to update ``I/O Intr`` records asynchronously, it uses
  ``DeviceVariable`` to specify which parameters to update.

The :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable` class as used by the
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` base class does not do much: apart from being
used as a handle, it provides access to the function and the
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceAddress`, and that's it. However,
``DeviceVariable`` is polymorphic and it is expected that the driver deriving
from :cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` will deal with subclasses of
``DeviceVariable``; see :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::createDeviceVariable()`.
The subclass (or subclasses, there can be several) can contain anything the
driver needs to work with the variable, like data type conversion, hardware
interrupt subscription, etc.

Similarly, :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceAddress` is a polymorphic class. The
only requirement is that it is equality-comparable to other addresses and that
two addresses compare equal when they refer to the same device variable. The
intent is that ``DeviceAddress`` represents the parsed device address that is
later used to construct ``DeviceVariable``.

Record processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How does the driver react to record processing?
```````````````````````````````````````````````

A driver subclassing :cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` registers **handlers** for
functions by calling :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::registerHandlers()` in its
constructor. The ``registerHandlers()`` method associates the combination of a
function name and a value type (see :cpp:class:`Autoparam::AsynType`) with a
read handler, a write handler and an interrupt registrar. The signatures depend
on the value type; they are grouped and documented in
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Handlers` structures.

Handlers take a reference to :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable` as the first
argument. The task of a read handler is to read the value of the requested
variable from the device and return it (for scalars) or write it to the provided
buffer (for arrays/waveforms). The task of the write handler is to write the
value given as its second argument to the requested variable on the device.

Both read and write handlers can be ``NULL``. In this case, a default handler is
used. For scalars, the default read handler simply returns the value stored in
the parameter associated with the device variable while the write handler stores
the value provided by the record in that same parameter. For arrays, both
handlers return an error since array parameters cannot store values themselves.

How does the driver process ``I/O Intr`` records?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

There are three mechanisms that can be used to push values into ``I/O Intr``
records that are appropriate for different situations:

* during or after running write or read handlers,
* in response to hardware interrupts,
* or at any other time, in particular from a background scanning thread.

Which mechanism is appropriate depends on the device; they may also be combined.


.. rubric:: During or after running write or read handlers

By default, should the write handler for some variable complete successfully,
the driver will automatically update the cached parameter value and process the
callbacks registered by ``I/O Intr`` records that are bound to the same variable
to update them with *the written value*. This follows the behavior of default
(i.e. ``NULL``) handlers and is appropriate when a device variable is not really
backed by hardware, but is a "soft" variable in the driver.

It may also be appropriate when the device variable is a "write-only" variable
and does not allow the driver to read back the value. In that case, the last
written value is the only data available, and updating the parameter after a
write allows one to have a ``NULL`` read handler that simply returns the last
written data.

While the default (i.e. ``NULL``) write handler *always* behaves like this, this
automatic processing of interrupts can be overridden for normal handlers either

* globally by :cpp:func:`Autoparam::DriverOpts::setAutoInterrupts()`
* or on a per-write (or read) basis by setting
  :cpp:member:`Autoparam::ResultBase::processInterrupts`.

The latter also allows *reads* to update ``I/O Intr`` records bound to the same
device variable. This is an edge use case and is thus not done by default, but
the mechanism is there and can be used explicitly.

A more common use case is a "write-read" operation which writes to the device
and obtains a readback of the value in the same transaction. The default
behavior of write handlers is not appropriate: while it does update the value of
``I/O Intr`` records, it uses the *value that was written*. To instead use the
value that was read back, the write handler should

* disable automatic processing of interrupts,
* then call :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::setParam()`,
  :cpp:func:`asynPortDriver::callParamCallbacks()` or
  :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::doCallbacksArray()` itself.


.. rubric:: From a background scanning thread

The approach used for write-read operations is generally applicable and can be
used anywhere. In particular, some devices can only operate efficiently if data
is requested periodically in large batches, and the driver needs to do this kind
of update in a background thread. When data arrives, the background thread can
update many scalar parameters by calling
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::setParam()`, then call
:cpp:func:`asynPortDriver::callParamCallbacks()` once. For arrays,
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::doCallbacksArray()` does both operations at the
same time.

Note that handlers are called with the driver locked. When using the above
functions (or any other driver function, for that matter) from a different
context (such as a background thread), ensure that the driver is locked (see
:cpp:func:`asynPortDriver::lock()` and :cpp:func:`asynPortDriver::unlock()`).

To make it easier for the background thread to know which device variables are
of interest, :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::getInterruptVariables()` returns a
list of ``DeviceVariable`` that one or more records have subscribed to. Be aware
that the list can change at any time, both during database initialization and
during runtime due to ``SCAN`` field changes.


.. rubric:: In response to hardware interrupts

Setting a parameter and calling the callbacks can be done in response to
hardware interrupts as well, in the same way as from a background thread.
However, hardware interrupts may need to be enabled, or, for network-connected
devices, an event subscription needs to be set up. This could, in principle, be
done by obtaining the list of required variables using the
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::getInterruptVariables()` method. However, as this
list can change at any time, something would need to check the list periodically
and enable or disable the appropriate interrupts.

A more appropriate approach is to register a function that is called whenever a
record's ``SCAN`` field changes to or from ``I/O Intr``. Such an
:cpp:type:`Autoparam::InterruptRegistrar` can be registered together with read
and write handlers.
