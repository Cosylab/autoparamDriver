Tutorial
========

**IN PROGRESS**

To learn how to use ``autoparamDriver``, we will imagine a simple device and
create a small library to talk to it; the library will, naturally, generate mock
data. We will then write a driver to integrate it into EPICS. While all of this
could be presented as a finished example application, it is more instructive to
show each step separately and explain the reasoning behind it.

Note that the tutorial uses the C++03 standard. You are free (and encouraged!)
to code in a later version of the standard.

Creating an app
---------------

First, assuming that ``autoparamDriver`` is already installed in your EPICS
environment, let's create the EPICS application structure for our tutorial::

  $ mkdir autoparamTutorial
  $ cd autoparamTutorial
  $ makeBaseApp.pl -t ioc autoparamTutorial
  $ makeBaseApp.pl -i -t ioc autoparamTutorial

If you don't know what the above commands do, please check out the `Application
Developer's Manual`_.

.. _Application Developer's Manual: https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/appdevguide/AppDevGuide.html

Modify the ``configuration/RELEASE`` file, setting the ``EPICS_BASE``, ``ASYN``
and ``AUTOPARAM`` variables to the locations where the respective modules are
installed.

Modify ``autoparamTutorialApp/src/Makefile``, adding::

  autoparamTutorialDBD += asyn.dbd
  autoparamTutorial_LIBS += autoparamDriver
  autoparamTutorial_LIBS += asyn
  autoparamTutorial_SRCS += tutorialDriver.cpp
  autoparamTutorial_SRCS += tutorialDevice.cpp

Modify ``autoparamTutorialApp/Db/Makefile``, adding::

  DB += tutorial.db

Create the source and database files, keeping them empty for now::

  touch autoparamTutorialApp/Db/tutorial.db autoparamTutorialApp/src/tutorial{Driver.cpp,Device.cpp,Device.h}

Run ``make``, then ``make distclean`` to ensure that the empty tutorial app
builds and that your EPICS environment is set up correctly. If these steps fail,
please explain how you previously managed to install ``autoparamDriver`` ðŸ˜‰

You are now all set up to start implementing the driver. From now on, all C++
driver code goes into ``tutorialDriver.cpp``, device simulation code goes into
``tutorialDevice.cpp`` and all database records go into ``tutorial.db``. Don't
forget to load the database in ``st.cmd``!

A mock device to work with
--------------------------

The device is a controller connected to several peripherals. It has a generic
interface, meaning that the library through which we access it knows nothing
about these peripherals. It only deals with addresses and values stored at these
addresses. It can access the data either as a single 16-bit word (little endian)
or as an array of 8-bit values. It also provides access to hardware interrupts.

The interface for such a generic controller, defined in ``tutorialDevice.h``, is
simple::

  enum DeviceStatus {
      DeviceSuccess,
      DeviceError
  };

  typedef void (*InterruptCallback) (void *userData);

  DeviceStatus initDevice(int deviceNum);
  DeviceStatus deinitDevice(int deviceNum);

  DeviceStatus readWord(int deviceNum, uint16_t address, uint16_t *value);
  DeviceStatus writeWord(int deviceNum, uint16_t address, uint16_t value);

  DeviceStatus readBytes(int deviceNum, uint16_t address, char *dest, uint16_t size);
  DeviceStatus writeBytes(int deviceNum, uint16_t address, char const *data, uint16_t size);

  DeviceStatus enableInterruptCallback(int deviceNum, uint8_t line,
                                       InterruptCallback callback,
                                       void *userData);
  DeviceStatus disableInterruptCallback(int deviceNum, uint8_t line);
  DeviceStatus triggerSoftwareInterrupt(int deviceNum, uint8_t line);

Implementing these functions is left as an exercise for the reader. Adding empty
stubs to ``tutorialDevice.cpp`` that simply return success should be enough for
the moment, allowing the code to compile and link. But it is more helpful if the
read functions return random data. It is also convenient if the
``triggerSoftwareInterrupt()`` function works and can be called from an IOC
shell command.

Before we start coding
----------------------

Before starting to code the driver, we need to think about how it will be used
to create an IOC. There are two aspects to this: the IOC shell script, and the
database. There's also a third point, the settings of the underlying
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver`, which we will consider in the next section.

The IOC shell script is where the driver is instantiated. This is done by
creating a shell command; how to do this is documented in the `Application
Developer's Manual`_. Normally, the IOC shell command would take some parameters
and pass them to the driver's constructor. Thus, any settings that the user of
the driver (i.e. the IOC author) needs to be able to set, become parameters to
both the constructor and the user-accessible iocsh command. However, in our
case, we are dealing with a very simple device API and there is nothing the user
needs to configure. Still, one parameter is always required: the user-provided
name of the asyn port.

As for the database, because we don't know in advance which peripherals will be
connected to the controller, we need to provide a way for the records to access
all addresses. We need to come up with a syntax for the records' input and
output links. The following examples seem to make sense for our device at this
point::

  field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT) WORD 0x1234)")
  field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT) BYTES 0x1234 13)")
  field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT) INTR 5)")

Constructing the driver
-----------------------

Let us begin by defining our class in ``tutorialDriver.cpp``::

  #include <tutorialDevice.h>
  #include <autoparamDriver.h>

  class TutorialDriver : public Autoparam::Driver {
    public:
      TutorialDriver(char const *portName, int deviceNum);
      ~TutorialDriver();

    private:
      int deviceNum;
  };

Our device requires that the constructor calls ``initDevice()``. But that's not
all. It also needs to call the base class constructor. As it happens,
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::Driver()` supports a fair number of options. It's
time to take a look at :cpp:class:`Autoparam::DriverOpts` and pick what we need.

* Our device is simulated, all functions return instantly. Therefore, we do not
  need to declare our driver as blocking.
* Connection management in an :cpp:class:`asynPortDriver` is â€¦ not easy, and way
  beyond the scope of this tutorial. It's also not necessary in our case since
  the device is always connected. So it's best to keep autoconnect enabled; this
  way, the asyn port will always appear connected.
* Many EPICS drivers have a very cavalier attitude towards cleanup. But our
  simple device API offers us the option to do things properly. So let's enable
  autodestruct, which will delete our driver when the IOC shuts down.
* We will disable auto interrupts. The defaults match the default behavior of
  :cpp:class:`asynPortDriver`'s default read and write handlers, but such
  behavior is rarely needed with real hardware.
* We have no reason to change the thread priority and stack size. In fact, we
  don't declare the driver as blocking, so there's no thread in the first place.
* We don't need to install an init hook. Our driver does not need that
  additional stage of initialization.

After these considerations, the constructor looks like this::

  TutorialDriver::TutorialDriver(char const *portName, int deviceNum)
      : Autoparam::Driver(
            portName,
            Autoparam::DriverOpts().setAutoDestruct().setAutoInterrupts(false)),
        deviceNum(deviceNum) {
      if (initDevice(deviceNum) == DeviceError) {
          asynPrint(pasynUserSelf, ASYN_TRACE_ERROR,
                    "Error initializing device!");
      }
  }

Hopefully, the device API is implemented such that it keeps failing if not
properly initialized. If it is not, we need to track the initialization status
in the driver. In this tutorial, we won't bother.

To clean up after ourselves, we need a destructor::

  TutorialDriver::~TutorialDriver() {
      if (deinitDevice(deviceNum) == DeviceError) {
          asynPrint(pasynUserSelf, ASYN_TRACE_ERROR,
                    "Error releasing device!");
      }
  }

To actually create an instance of the driver, we also need an iocsh command,
which requires a bit of boilerplate::

  static int const num_args = 2;
  static iocshArg const arg1 = {"port_name", iocshArgString};
  static iocshArg const arg2 = {"device_num", iocshArgInt};
  static iocshArg const *const args[num_args] = {&arg1, &arg2};
  static char const *const usage = "Instantiate a port driver for the tutorial device.\n";

  static iocshFuncDef command = {"drvTutorialConfigure", num_args, args, usage};

  static void call(iocshArgBuf const *args) {
      new TutorialDriver(args[0].sval, args[1].ival);
  }

  extern "C" {

  static void tutorialDriverCommandRegistrar() { iocshRegister(&command, call); }

  epicsExportRegistrar(tutorialDriverCommandRegistrar);
  }

Don't forget to add the registrar to a ``dbd`` file, and to call the command
from the IOC shell. By the way, see how we allocated the driver with ``new``,
then threw away the pointer? The autodestruct option takes care of calling
``delete`` when the IOC exits.

The code won't build yet because our ``TutorialDriver`` is still an abstract
class: we have not yet implemented the functions that deal with parsing records'
input and output links. So let's get to it.

.. _parsing:

Parsing arguments and creating device variables
-----------------------------------------------

Because you have read :ref:`concepts`, you already understand the concepts of
*device address* and *device variable*. Let's take a look at how to implement
them for our mock device.

Based on our considerations on what the ``INP`` field of a record might look
like, we see that our driver needs three distinct functions:

* ``WORD`` takes one argument, the variable address. The value there is an
  integer, so it makes sense to bind this function to the ``asynInt32``
  interface, represented by the ``epicsInt32`` type.
* ``BYTES`` takes two argument, an address and a length. The value is a byte
  array, so this function should be bound to the ``asynInt8Array``, represented
  by the ``Autoparam::Array<epicsInt8>`` type.
* ``INTR``, in principle, takes one argument: the interrupt line which
  identifies the source of interrupts. The API we are using can only notify us
  when an interrupt happens and cannot pass a value. As we are working on a
  generic driver, we don't know what the interrupt means. We need to provide a
  way for the database designer to act meaningfully. To do this, let's bind this
  function to the ``epicsInt32`` type and have it take an additional parameter.
  This allows the database to specify both the interrupt line and some register
  address to read a value from.

We will see how to implement these device functions in the next section. Before
we can do that, we need some kind of handle that we can use to refer to data on
the device.

:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Driver` requires two steps to create a handle from an
``INP`` or an ``OUT`` field of a record. First, we need to derive a class from
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceAddress` and override
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::parseDeviceAddress()` to instantiate it.
Looking at the three functions we need to distinguish, the following should be
sufficient::

  using namespace Autoparam::Convenience;

  class TutorialAddress : public DeviceAddress {
    public:
      enum Type { Word, Bytes, Intr };

      Type type;
      epicsUInt16 address;
      epicsUInt16 sizeOrIntrLine;

      bool operator==(DeviceAddress const& other) const {
          TutorialAddress const &o = static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(other);
          if (type != o.type) return false;
          switch (type) {
              case Word:
                  return address == o.address;
              case Intr:
              case Bytes:
                  return address == o.address && sizeOrIntrLine == o.sizeOrIntrLine;
          }
      }
  };

Notice that we imported the :cpp:any:`Autoparam::Convenience` namespace,
which provides several often-needed symbols, such as ``DeviceAddress`` or
``Array``.

We have to provide the equality operator because that is required by the
``DeviceAddress`` interface. It is used by the Autoparam machinery to identify
records that refer to the same underlying variable. We could also provide a
constructor, but because this is a simple class where everything is public, this
can be delegated to the factory function which we need to implement anyway::

  DeviceAddress *TutorialDriver::parseDeviceAddress(std::string const &function,
                                                    std::string const &arguments) {
      TutorialAddress *addr = new TutorialAddress;
      std::istringstream is(arguments);
      is >> std::setbase(0);

      if (function == "WORD") {
          addr->type = TutorialAddress::Word;
          is >> addr->address;
      } else if (function == "BYTES") {
          addr->type = TutorialAddress::Bytes;
          is >> addr->address;
          is >> addr->sizeOrIntrLine;
      } else if (function == "INTR") {
          addr->type = TutorialAddress::Intr;
          is >> addr->sizeOrIntrLine;
          is >> addr->address;
      } else {
          delete addr;
          return NULL;
      }

      return addr;
  }

Notice that the "WORD" function only takes an address, the "BYTES" function
takes and address and size, and the "INTR" function takes first the interrupt
line, then the address to read a value from.

This function is called with the string given in an ``INP`` or ``OUT`` field.
Parsing the provided arguments is very simple in our case. Even so, this
function is *too* simple: there is no error handling! It is elided for clarity,
but this code is dealing with user-provided strings, and mistakes happen often,
so in a real driver, make sure you check all arguments for validity!

Next, we implement the device variable handle based on
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable`::

  class TutorialVariable : public DeviceVariable {
    public:
      TutorialVariable(TutorialDriver *driver, DeviceVariable *baseVar)
          : DeviceVariable(baseVar), driver(driver) {}
      TutorialDriver *driver;
  };

A bit of "magic" happens here. The only thing we may do with the ``baseVar``
pointer is to pass it to the base class constructor, which takes ownership of
that data. This also includes the ``TutorialAddress`` that is created in the
previous step, and is now available as
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::DeviceVariable::address()`. Our simple device doesn't need
more than this in the handle: the address and size are all that's needed to use
the device API.

But one thing that is *very* convenient to add is a pointer to the driver
instance that this handle is related to. You will see why in a moment, as we get
around to implementing handlers for our device functions. But first, we must not
forget to implement the function that creates our variable handles::

  DeviceVariable *TutorialDriver::createDeviceVariable(DeviceVariable *baseVar) {
      return new TutorialVariable(this, baseVar);
  }

With the two factory functions implemented, our driver is not an abstract class
anymore, and the program compiles.

.. _devfuncs:

Implementing device functions
-----------------------------

To declare which functions our driver supports, we provide handlers and register
them. The handlers are static functions which we add to the driver. The
declaration of our class now looks like this::

  class TutorialDriver : public Autoparam::Driver {
    public:
      TutorialDriver(char const *portName, int deviceNum);
      ~TutorialDriver();

    protected:
      static Result<epicsInt32> wordReader(DeviceVariable &variable);
      static WriteResult wordWriter(DeviceVariable &variable, epicsInt32 value);

      static ArrayReadResult bytesReader(DeviceVariable &variable, Array<epicsInt8> &value);
      static WriteResult bytesWriter(DeviceVariable &variable, Array<epicsInt8> const &value);

      static Result<epicsInt32> errReader(DeviceVariable &variable);
      static WriteResult errWriter(DeviceVariable &variable, epicsInt32 value);
      static asynStatus intrRegistrar(DeviceVariable &variable, bool cancel);
      static void intrCallback(void* userData);

    private:
      int deviceNum;
  };

and the constructor is extended with the following calls::

  registerHandlers<epicsInt32>("WORD", wordReader, wordWriter, NULL);
  registerHandlers<Array<epicsInt8>>("BYTES", bytesReader, bytesWriter, NULL);
  registerHandlers<epicsInt32>("INTR", intrReader, intrWriter, intrRegistrar);

The signatures that read and write handlers must have are documented in
:cpp:struct:`Autoparam::Handlers`. Let's take a look at how to implement them.

Words of wisdom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Getting words into and out of our device is very simple, thanks to the
straightforward device API. The read handler can be implemented as::

  Result<epicsInt32> TutorialDriver::wordReader(DeviceVariable &variable) {
      Result<epicsInt32> result;
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable.address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = static_cast<TutorialVariable &>(variable).driver;
      uint16_t value;
      DeviceStatus status = readWord(driver->deviceNum, addr.address, &value);

      if (status != DeviceSuccess) {
          result.status = asynError;
          return result;
      }

      result.value = static_cast<epicsInt32>(value);
      return result;
  }

This handler is called whenever a record that is using ``asynInt32`` as its DTYP
and whose INP field uses the "WORD" function is processed. ``autoparamDriver``
handles this dispatching for us, so there is no need to check ``addr.type``,
except for debug purposes. The ``result`` object contains both the value and
status of the operation. In case of error, we only set the ``status`` field of
the result; this instructs ``asyn`` to assign to the record a status appropriate
to the operation. As we are dealing with a read, the record will be put into
READ alarm. Other ``asynStatus`` values are handled similarly. If we had reason
to, we could use the ``alarmStatus`` and ``alarmSeverity`` fields of
:cpp:struct:`Autoparam::ResultBase` to override the record status and severity
manually.

Notice how we cast the address and the variable references: we use
``static_cast`` instead of ``dynamic_cast`` because we know that the handler was
given the objects of the derived types we had instantiated in
``parseDeviceAddress()`` and ``createDeviceVariable()``. This allows us to get
to the fields of ``TutorialAddress`` and ``TutorialVariable``. It also makes it
clear why putting a pointer to the driver into ``TutorialVariable`` was a good
idea: that is how we get the device number that the driver uses to talk to the
device.

This is a general pattern when working with ``autoparamDriver``: handlers have
to be static functions instead of member functions because of restrictions of
C++2003, yet it is a good idea to declare them inside the driver class so that
they can access private members of the driver. They can obtain the pointer to
the driver via the ``DeviceVariable`` they are given. This approximates a member
function. Python fans can even name the driver pointer ``self`` ðŸ˜‰

Writing works similarly::

  WriteResult TutorialDriver::wordWriter(DeviceVariable &variable, epicsInt32 value) {
      WriteResult result;
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable.address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = static_cast<TutorialVariable &>(variable).driver;

      if (value > 0xffff || value < 0) {
          result.status = asynOverflow;
          return result;
      }

      DeviceStatus status = writeWord(driver->deviceNum, addr.address,
                                      static_cast<uint16_t>(value));

      if (status != DeviceSuccess) {
          result.status = asynError;
          return result;
      }

      return result;
  }

Our interface towards EPICS records uses ``epicsInt32`` whereas the device needs
``uint16_t``, which is why we need to check whether the value we were given is
within range.

Check that reading and writing register values works with your implementation of
the device API (which is not covered here) with these records::

  record(longin, "$(PREFIX):wordin") {
      field(SCAN, "1 second")
      field(DTYP, "asynInt32")
      field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT)) WORD 0x1234")
  }

  record(longout, "$(PREFIX):wordout") {
      field(DTYP, "asynInt32")
      field(OUT, "@asyn($(PORT)) WORD 0x1234")
  }


Byte only what you can chew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arrays are handled similarly to scalars, with the difference that an array is
passed as a wrapper object which acts as a reference to an actual array. This
avoids unnecessary copies of possibly large amounts of data. Apart from that,
the read handler should look familiar::

  ArrayReadResult TutorialDriver::bytesReader(DeviceVariable &variable,
                                              Array<epicsInt8> &value) {
      ArrayReadResult result;
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable.address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = static_cast<TutorialVariable &>(variable).driver;

      if (addr.sizeOrIntrLine > value.maxSize()) {
          result.status = asynOverflow;
          return result;
      }

      char *data = reinterpret_cast<char *>(value.data());
      DeviceStatus status = readBytes(driver->deviceNum, addr.address, data,
                                      addr.sizeOrIntrLine);

      if (status != DeviceSuccess) {
          result.status = asynError;
          return result;
      }

      value.setSize(addr.sizeOrIntrLine);
      return result;
  }

An important point here is the size of the array. The
:cpp:class:`Autoparam::Array` wrapper gives both the current size and maximum
size of the underlying array. These values correspond to the NORD and NELM
fields of the underlying waveform record, respectively. In other words, a read
handler needs to check that the size to be read is not larger than the maximum
size the destination can hold. After a successful read, the current size of the
destination array needs to be set to the number of elements read.

Similarly, when writing to the device, the current size of the given array needs
to be checked against the size of the array on device::

  WriteResult TutorialDriver::bytesWriter(DeviceVariable &variable,
                                          Array<epicsInt8> const &value) {
      WriteResult result;
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable.address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = static_cast<TutorialVariable &>(variable).driver;

      if (value.size() > addr.sizeOrIntrLine) {
          result.status = asynOverflow;
          return result;
      }

      char const *data = reinterpret_cast<char const *>(value.data());
      DeviceStatus status = writeBytes(driver->deviceNum, addr.address,
                                       data, value.size());

      if (status != DeviceSuccess) {
          result.status = asynError;
          return result;
      }

      return result;
  }

In the case of the tutorial device, the size of the device array is given as
part of the address, for both reads and writes. To check the behavior, we can
use a database such as the following::

  record(waveform, "$(PREFIX):arrin") {
      field(SCAN, "1 second")
      field(DTYP, "asynInt8ArrayIn")
      field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT)) BYTES 0x2234 8")
      field(FTVL, "CHAR")
      field(NELM, "10")
  }

  record(waveform, "$(PREFIX):arrin_fail") {
      field(SCAN, "1 second")
      field(DTYP, "asynInt8ArrayIn")
      field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT)) BYTES 0x3234 18")
      field(FTVL, "CHAR")
      field(NELM, "10")
  }

The first record should work while the second should fail with status of
HWLIMIT.

Please, do disturb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As discussed in :ref:`parsing`, the "INTR" function takes an interrupt line and
an address to read from. This handles the simple case when the user of our
driver only needs to read a value in response to a hardware interrupt.

Remember how we called ``registerHandlers()`` in :ref:`devfuncs`? For "WORD"
and "BYTES", the last argument was ``NULL``, but for "INTR", we passed the
``intrRegistrar`` function. Here it is::

  asynStatus TutorialDriver::intrRegistrar(DeviceVariable &variable, bool cancel) {
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable.address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = static_cast<TutorialVariable &>(variable).driver;

      DeviceStatus status;
      if (!cancel) {
          status = enableInterruptCallback(driver->deviceNum, addr.sizeOrIntrLine,
                                           intrCallback, &variable);
      } else {
          status = disableInterruptCallback(driver->deviceNum, addr.sizeOrIntrLine);
      }

      return status == DeviceSuccess ? asynSuccess : asynError;
  }

Any number of records can refer to the given ``variable`` whose SCAN fields can
switch to and from "I/OÂ Intr" at any time. When the first record goes "I/OÂ Intr", this function is called with ``cancel = false``. When there are again no
records in "I/OÂ Intr", it is called with ``cancel = true``.

Our device API allows us to specify a callback function that is called with an
arbitrary argument when an interrupt happens. In this function, we perform a
read and then notify all records that are interested in interrupts for this
variable, like so::

  void TutorialDriver::intrCallback(void *userData) {
      TutorialVariable *variable = static_cast<TutorialVariable *>(userData);
      TutorialAddress const &addr =
          static_cast<TutorialAddress const &>(variable->address());
      TutorialDriver *driver = variable->driver;

      driver->lock();
      epicsUInt16 value;
      DeviceStatus status = readWord(driver->deviceNum, addr.address, &value);
      asynStatus astatus = status == DeviceSuccess ? asynSuccess : asynError;
      driver->setParam(*variable, epicsInt32(value), astatus);
      driver->callParamCallbacks();
      driver->unlock();
  }

Note first that we need to lock the driver whenever we talk to the device or use
the driver itself. We don't need to do it in handler functions because EPICS and
asyn already hold the lock when the handlers are called. This is not the case
with our callback which can be called by the device API at any time.

Notice how we used the :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::setParam` function to set a
value of a parameter, then called ``callParamCallbacks()``. ``setParam()``
writes our value into a value cache maintained by asyn. The
``callParamCallbacks()`` function then goes through all the values provided and
processes only the records bound to parameters that have changed. This is
convenient because we don't need to check for changes ourselves, the asyn
machinery takes care of this for us. If we obtain values for several device
variables in one operation, we can call ``setParam()`` for all of them, then
call ``callParamCallbacks()`` only once. Note that this is only available for
scalars: arrays can be big and need to be handled one-by-one; see
:cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::doCallbacksArray()`.

It may or may not make sense to allow normal reads and writes to variables of
the "INTR" type. Suppose we want to forbid reads and writes. One is tempted to
pass ``NULL`` to the :cpp:func:`Autoparam::Driver::registerHandlers()` function.
This works, but doesn't forbid reading and/or writing. Instead, it installs
*default handlers*. These handlers use the same value cache as ``setParam()``
and thus allow you to have "soft" values that are not backed by the device. This
functionality is inherited from the underlying ``asynPortDriver``. If you wish
to forbid reads and writes, simply create handlers that always return
``asynError``::

  Result<epicsInt32> TutorialDriver::errReader(DeviceVariable &variable) {
      Result<epicsInt32> result;
      result.status = asynError;
      return result;
  }

  WriteResult TutorialDriver::errWriter(DeviceVariable &variable, epicsInt32 value) {
      WriteResult result;
      result.status = asynError;
      return result;
  }

To test the interrupt functionality, a record like this can be used to read
register 0x1234 in response to interrupts on line 3::

  record(longin, "$(PREFIX):intrtest") {
      field(SCAN, "Passive")
      field(DTYP, "asynInt32")
      field(INP, "@asyn($(PORT)) INTR 3 0x1234")
  }

Implementing the device API for interrupts and the iocsh command to trigger a
software interrupt is left as an exercise for the reader.
